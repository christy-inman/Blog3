# Frank && Frieda's Fetching Service
### The Promise Chain: A Short Story


   *{{**beepBeep, beepBeep...beepBeep, beepBeep...**}}*


Frank the function had to work overtime yesterday because his clients kept sending him down bad routes. He attempted his deliveries until late in the night when the clients finally stopped making requests. This caused such exhaustion that he slept through his alarm this morning.


   *{{**...beepBeep, BeepBeep...BeepBeep, BeepBeep!**}}*


"No...tried to warn them...", Frank mumbled in his sleep. "...bad route...blocked request...not...function", he continued muttering, growing more agitated in his dream state. Frank started so intensely from the current scene playing in his mind, that he woke himself up from the dreary retelling of his previous work day.

Glad to be out of that nightbore, Frank decided to get his day started early even though his alarm hadn't sounded yet. He got up and took an extra long shower to wash away his dreams and reset on a positive note for his new day at work.
As he was drying off, Frank heard a request ping from his phone. He checked it, saw the time, and instantly started to panic. He was late for work, he wasn't even dressed and already had his first request for a delivery.

Throwing on the first shirt and pair of pants he grabbed, Frank stummbled down the stairs to meet his roommate just coming home from her night at work. "Frank!", she exclaimed. "One, what are you still doing here?! And two, why haven't you done any of you chores?". Frieda continued, "You promised you would do them after work yesterday."

"I know, I know, I'm sorry", Frank stammered. "It's just that, my clients made a LOT of bad requests yesterday, and I had to work a double shift trying to fetch all of their deliveries...so I got home really late and exhausted, so exhausted I passed out right away and slept through my alarm this morning, and now I'm late for work", he continued as he grabbed a bagel for the road. "SsOoo, long story short, I had bad requests all day, and so I couldn't fulfill my promise to you. And now I have to go fetch this delivery request."

"I promise I will do my chores when I get back, and then I will even make you muffins!", Frank yelled as the door swung shut behind him. Frank's day at work went much smoother today, most of his clients were making successful requests and he was using lots of well established routes. Even when there were errors, his clients quickly read his messages and fixed the mistakes.

After a satifying day of fetching client requests, Frank made his way back home, stopping for one last personal fetch of batter for the muffins and cleaning supplies to do his chores. When Frank finally got home from his full day of fetching, he unpacked his grocery load.

Then, Frank started his chores. First, he put away the clean dishes, and washed all of the dirty dishes.

Then he dusted the counters and vaccumed the floors in the livingroom.

Then, since he was finished with his chores, Frank decided to preheat the oven and make the muffins before Frieda woke up for her shift fetching their client's requests.

Then, once the oven was hot, Frank put the muffins in to bake. He got ready for bed while he waited for the oven timer to ding.

Then, Frank finished his promise chain by putting the warm muffins on the counter for Frieda to find and enjoy with her coffee before she heads to work.

After a successful day of fetching and flawlessly fulfilling his promises, Frank fell fast asleep. And rested calmly all night, free from worry or stress dreams, until his alarm softly sounded again.

**[[THE END]]**


I have heard instructors and coaches at school, and some presenters at meet-ups talk a lot about code telling a story. That when you read a file it should speak for itself and not need much commenting to explain what is happening, because the function names and variables should be very descriptive of what they do/are. This story mentality idea got me thinking more about implementing that in my code, and wanting to write an actual story that could then be shown in a code story. So while this is meant as a cute short story to explain some of the happenings of a promise chain, it is also a riddle to serve as a hint to the syntactic code story that I will post in my next blog post. See if you can figure out what Frank the function's day would look like, and come back to check my next post to see how close you got. Happy Hacking!
